  <h1 id="first">Who Am I?</h1>
  <p>
    I am a high school student who has been involved in various computer science classes and have also been involved in some extra curriculars involving computer science. I have taken classes such as Computer Science Principles, Java, and Web Design. I have also taken PLTW classes such as Intro to Engineering Design, Principles of Engineering, and Civil Engineering and Architecture. I am interested in doing computer science and programming and have done various <a href="work.html">projects</a> with my knowledge of programming.

  <h1>Interests</h1>
  <p>
    I have an interest in most things that have to do with programming. I know various languages such as Java, C#, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My preferred language of choice is Java.
    <br><br>
    I'm wanting to go into a career path that would include programming. I would like to learn C as well as C++ and would be willing to learn other languages if necessary for a career. I am more interested in doing back end work rather than front end work.
