  <h1 id="first">Why Use Github?</h1>
  <p>
    If you are new to programming you may be wondering, why does everyone use Github or even what is <a href="https://www.github.com/">Github</a>?<br><br>
    Github is a platform where developers are able, and encouraged, to store their code, distribute products, and even do version control. Github is by far one of the most widely used platforms to store code and is built off of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">git</a>.<br><br>
    Another platform that is used is <a href="https://bitbucket.org/product">Bitbucket</a> which also uses git, however Bitbucket is used less widely as it is meant for teams of programmers working together and often costs money in order to provide services for larger groups.<br><br>
    Github on the other hand is free for users and even has a <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">Student Discount</a> deal. Github makes it easy for others to work on open source projects as you can browse projects from other people making it a great community to learn from and often times you can find other projects that could help you out.

  <h1>Why Open Source?</h1>
  <p>
    As you have just learned, Github makes it easy for developers to make their projects open sourced and makes it easy for others to find their programs. There are many reasons for developers to make their products open sourced.
    <br><br>
    One of the main reasons developers should make their projects open sourced is because it gives other developers somewhere to learn from. Making projects open sourced also allows others to help develop their programs for them which allows for products that were seemingly abandoned by the original developer to still get continued updates.

  <h1>Learning and Help Platforms?</h1>
  <p>
    If you are interested in learning more about programming I would recommend looking into <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools</a> if you are interested in developing web pages and if you are interested in learning about other languages look into <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>.
    <br><br>
    If you run into roadblocks while learning to program or even when you know how to program a website that helps immensely is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> where other developers help answer questions of other developers. You could also try just looking up the issue you are having on Google.
